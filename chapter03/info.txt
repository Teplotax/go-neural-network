- Installed tensor package: 
go get -u "gorgonia.org/tensor"

- A tensor is a represented by a 3d homologous array
- The dotProduct is the for loop multiplying the inputs and weights
>>> neuronOutput = dotProduct + bias

- Its beneficial to work with batches of inputs to train the neural network
- it was necessary to implement a method to reshape the rawBiases to add to de dotProduct tensor
